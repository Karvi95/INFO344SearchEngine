-Section 0: Data Cleaning
Frustratingly, the wikipedia dump includes not only random punctuation marks in the page titles, but also denotes (spaces) with (underscores). Thus, it was imperative to run the following two grep commands: 
						grep -v '[^a-zA-Z_]' enwiki-20170101-all-titles-in-ns0 > output.txt
						grep -rl  '_' output.txt | xargs sed -i 's/_/ /g
the first one searchs the file for all non punctuation, except for underscores, marks and outputs them to a text file and then the second one searches for the remaining underscores and replaces thme with spaces. 

---Trie---
-Section 1: Constructing Trie
I had constructed a Trie when preparing for interviews in Java so I was able to recall my knowledge of that implementation and adapt what we learned in class (for example, the auto property unique to C#) to write up the TrieNode, Trie constructor and insert method which were then validated with these resources: https://leetcode.com/articles/implement-trie-prefix-tree/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXjmTQ8LEoI .
-Section 2: Retrieving 10 results from Trie
This was very difficult. The first resource above gave me a hint; I was to find the prefix of the user input string first before I returned any matches at all. Secondly, I used the hint given in class to adapt the Depth-First-Search pattern. The following was my thought process:
